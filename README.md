# Ducky-Script-For-FlipperZero
This repo is a collection of Duckie Scripts which have been updated specifically For badUSB function on the FlipperZero. 
They should however work just fine on any device that uses Ducky Script.
These scripts range from harmless pranks to nefarious red team tools. For educational purposes only! :)  

# Note
Most of these scripts were designed to avoid downloading external scripts or programs.

# Pre-Deployment Setup
Most of these scripts will require some setup before they will work.
Make sure to read through all the scripts and follow any setup instructions.
